# Body Orientation Illustration

This repository is an introduction to Rrproducibility Research. Our intention is to share a dataset from the assesment of depth cameras for calculating body orientations. 

The files contained are:
- A Jupyter Notebook to run one of the plot functions which includes the plot configuration and data upload from an CSV file
- A CSV file with post processed data from the experiments run
